        <h1>South African municipal elections 2016</h1>
        <h3>A visual comparison of party effort across municipalities / districts.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row row-blurb">
        <p>With South Africa's municipal elections in a few days time (3rd August 2016), I wondered about the effort being expended by the parties in each district or municipality. Has it increased or decreased since the 2011 elections? I must point out that I am not a political analyst or a political scientist. I am nevertheless a scientist with an appreciation for analytics.</p>
        <p>Employing and promoting candidates costs money. Assuming that our political parties don't have infinite financial resources it follows that investigating where they invest their resources may be a reasonable proxy for effort. Furthermore, looking at the change in effort adds a temporal dimension, suggesting where effort has increased or decreased between the elections.</p>
        <p>The map below shows the change in PR candidate representation by each party across the county. If you hover your mouse pointer over a district, you can see by how much the representation has changed in terms of two metrics:</p>
        <p><strong>Relative change</strong>: The change in representation as a proportion of all representatives. E.g. In 2011 parties A and B each had 50% of a district's PR candidates. In 2016 party A has 60% and party B has 40%. Party A's relative change is 10% and party B's is -10%.</p>
        <p><strong>Absolute change</strong>: The change in actual number of PR candidates in a party from 2011 to 2016.</p>
        <p>Scroll below the map for more info regarding data sources and methods.</p>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: As I said though, I am no political scientist and so maybe this is all nonsense.</em></p>

        <h4>Data sources</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.elections.org.za">Independent Electoral Commission</a> have published the <a href="http://www.elections.org.za/content/Elections/Candidates-lists/">2016 candidate lists</a> as pdf documents. The good people at <a href="https://africaopendata.org/">openAfrica</a> have already gone to the trouble of <a href="https://africaopendata.org/dataset/electoral-candidates-2016">processing these pdfs</a> (which can be a bit painful) so I used their lists instead. openAfrica also host the <a href="https://africaopendata.org/dataset/electoral-commission-of-south-africa-local-government-election-candidates">2011</a> candidate lists. After learning a little more about the electoral system, it seemed that the proportional representative candidates would be the interesting group to look at.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.demarcation.org.za/">Municipal Demarcation Board</a> website hosts shape files for South Africa's <a href="http://www.demarcation.org.za/index.php/downloads/boundary-data/boundary-data-main-files/districts">districts</a> and <a href="http://www.demarcation.org.za/index.php/downloads/boundary-data/boundary-data-main-files/province">provinces</a>.</p>
        <h4>R data processing</h4>
        <p>Some simple wrangling in R (scroll down for the process) exposed the list of district codes which I joined with the appropriate candidate lists from each election year. From there I produced a list of parties, ordered by the total number of district or municipal representatives. The Economic Freedom Fighters lead this list with a total of 1501 candidates, 106 more than the African National Congress and 139 more than the Democratic Alliance. These are the three largest parties which is why I mention them. I chose to load the map with ANC data because the EFF didn't exist during the 2011 elections and so they've not decreased in any provinces. I believe that a few candidates have withdrawn from the elections. I'm not sure who they were but I doubt their withdrawal would make any substantive change to this analysis.</p>
